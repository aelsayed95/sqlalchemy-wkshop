In the last step, we had seen that `db_accessor.py` used `psycopg2`, the PostgreSQL database adapter, to interact with the database.
In this section, we will introduce SQLAlchemy, whose core will act as an abstraction layer to connect with the PostgresSQL database.

## Engine

Let's create `db/base.py` in the `marketsvc` folder to keep the database connection configuration in one place. 

Here we create the [`Engine`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) object, which is the entry point of any SQLAlchemy application. The `Engine` serves as the main source of DBAPI connections to a given database. 

##### marketsvc/db/base.py

```py
import os
from sqlalchemy import URL, create_engine

url_object = URL.create(
    "postgresql+psycopg2",
    username=os.environ.get("POSTGRES_USER"),
    password=os.environ.get("POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
    host=os.environ.get("POSTGRES_DB"),
    database=os.environ.get("POSTGRES_DB"),
    port=os.environ.get("POSTGRES_PORT"),
)

engine = create_engine(url_object, echo=True)
```

We create the `Engine` with the `create_engine()` method. Here, we have passed in a `URL` object to `create_engine()`, which includes all the necessary information required to connect to a database:
- Type of database, represented by `postgresql`. 
    - This instructs SQLAlchemy to use the PostgreSQL [**dialect**](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/glossary.html#term-dialect), which is a system used to communicate with various kinds of databases and their respective drivers.
- DBAPI, represented by `psycopg2`.
    - [**DBAPI**](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/glossary.html#term-DBAPI) (Python Database API Specification) is a driver that SQLAlchemy uses to connect to a database. It's a "low level" API that lets Python talk to the database.
- Database connection configuration like host, port, database, username, and password.

We've also enabled the `echo` flag, which will log the generated SQL queries by SQLAlchemy. We'll display these logs to explain what happens behind the scenes.

> **Lazy Connecting**
> 
> When `create_engine()` first returns an `Engine` object, it will not reach out to the database yet. It will wait for a task to be performed against the database, such as a SELECT query, and then connect to the database, following the [lazy initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization) design pattern.


## Connection

Once our `Engine` object is ready, it will be used to connect to the database by providing a unit of connectivity called the [`Connection`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html).

`Connection` is a proxy object for an actual DBAPI connection, and provides services to execute SQL statements and transaction control, and this is how we'll interact with the database. The `Connection` is acquired by `Engine.connect()`.

We don't want to keep a `Connection` running indefinitely, and thus, the recommended way to use `Connection` is with context managers, which will frame the operations inside into a transaction, and will invoke `Connection.close()` at the end of the block.

## Executing Queries

Here, we see how we can execute queries with SQLAlchemy. For now, we'll be using raw SQL. Let's update `execute_query()` in `db_accessor.py` to use the `Connection` using a context manager.

##### marketsvc/db_accessor.py

```py
from db.base import engine
from sqlalchemy import text

def execute_query(query, params=None):
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        return conn.execute(text(query), params)
```

The `get_customers()` function in `db_accessor.py` will then call `execute_query()`.

```py
def get_customers():
    rows = execute_query("SELECT * FROM customer")
    return rows
```

The statement is executed with the `Connection.execute()` function, which returns a `Result` that represents an iterable object of resulting rows, depicted by `Row`.

In order to format the response correctly, let's edit the `customers()` function in `server.py` to get the `Row` objects as dictionaries.

##### marketsvc/server.py

```py
@app.route("/api/customers")
def customers():
    customers = get_customers()
    response = [customer._asdict() for customer in customers]
    return jsonify(response)
```

At this point, the API to fetch customers is updated to use SQLAlchemy. Try it with:

```sh
./run.sh customers
```

##### SQLAlchemy logs:
```sql
BEGIN (implicit)
SELECT * FROM customer
[generated in 0.00021s] {}
ROLLBACK
```

As you can see from the logs, a **ROLLBACK** was emitted at the end. This marked the of the transaction. An automatic rollback occurs when a connection is closed after use, to ensure that the connection is 'clean' for its next use.

## Parameter Binding

We might want to select specific rows, or insert some data to the table. The `Connection.execute()` function can accept parameters called [**bound parameters**](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/glossary.html#term-bound-parameters). We indicate the presense of parameters in the `text()` construct by using colons, such as `:customer_id`. We can then send the actual value of these parameters as a dictionary in the second argument of `Connection.execute()`; for example,

```py
conn.execute(
            text("SELECT * FROM customer WHERE id=:customer_id"),
            {"customer_id": 1},
        )
```

> ##### WARNING
> 
> Never put variables directly in the query string. Doing so leaves your code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. **Always** use parameter binding. Using parameters allows the dialect and DBAPI to correctly handle the input, and enables the driver to have the best performance.
{: .block-danger }

If we want to send multiple sets of parameters, such as insert multiple records in the table, we can pass a **list of dictionaries** to `Connection.execute()` and send multiple parameter sets. The SQL statement will be executed once for each parameter set.


## Committing Data

You might have noticed the absense of the **COMMIT** statement from the SQLAlchemy logs. If we want to commit some data, we need to explicitly call [`Connection.commit()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.commit) inside the block.

Let's update `execute_insert_query()` to invoke `Connection.commit()`.

##### marketsvc/db_accessor.py

```py
def execute_insert_query(query, params=None):
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        result = conn.execute(text(query), params)
        conn.commit()
        return result
```

Let's also bind some parameters to the query in `add_new_order_for_customer()`.

```py
def add_new_order_for_customer(customer_id, items):
    try:
        result = execute_insert_query(
            """`
            INSERT INTO orders
                (customer_id, order_time)
            VALUES
                (:customer_id, NOW())
            RETURNING id
            """,
            {"customer_id": customer_id},
        )
        new_order_id = result.one().id
        
        return True

    except Exception:
        return False
```

If you were to run `add_new_order_for_customer()` at this point, where you insert a row in the `orders` table, the logs generated by SQLAlchemy would look like the following.

##### SQLAlchemy logs:
```sql
BEGIN (implicit)
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_time) VALUES (%(customer_id)s, NOW()) RETURNING id
[generated in 0.00041s] {'customer_id': 1}
COMMIT
```

As you can see, `conn.commit()` committed the transaction, and the statement **COMMIT** is logged, as compared to **ROLLBACK** in the previous example. We can then call `conn.commit()` for committing additional statements. This style is called **commit as you go**. 

However, if an exception occurs duing the transaction, the changes will be rolled back and a **ROLLBACK** will be displayed instead.

{: .block-tip }

Once you've implemented this, you can hit the `add_new_order` API to add an  order. To make this easier, you can use the following command:

```sh
./run.sh neworder
```

&nbsp;

Another way to commit data is to use the context manager `Engine.begin()` instead of `Engine.connect()`. It will declare the whole block to be one transcation block, and will enclose everything inside the transaction with one **COMMIT** at the end. This method is called **begin once**.

```py
with engine.begin() as conn:
    result = conn.execute(text("INSERT INTO orders..."), params)
```

##### SQLAlchemy logs:
```sql
BEGIN (implicit)
INSERT INTO orders ...
[generated in 0.00041s] {...}
COMMIT
```

Notice there is a **COMMIT** without explicitly writing `conn.commit()`.

Now that we've added SQLAlchemy, let's eliminate raw SQL text and introduce ORMs!
